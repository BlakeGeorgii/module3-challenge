#Module 3 Challenge

##Description

The challenge was to create a password generator. I did this by creating the "generatePassword()" function which took user inputs through window alerts and used Math.random() to create a password based off the inputs. Through the challenge I've gotten a firm grasp on the basics of javascript. The finished project was pushed to the repository, published on GitHub Pages and turned in through bootcampspot.
